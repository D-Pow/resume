Founded isomorphic SSR/CSR codebase for entire site, accelerating build speed, client performance, and pipeline parallelization.

• Reduced local dev resource consumption by 70% via novel dev-server to replace cumbersome Docker/Python/Webpack combo, improving dev experience and productivity across the entire company.
• Unified state and file structure, aggregating common needs for many teams into a single source of truth.
• Solved org-wide unit-test issues plaguing devs for years in a matter of weeks via customizable util functions for async logic, user interactions, redirects, and mocks.

Converted entire site from Flow to TypeScript, consisting of millions of lines of code via homebrewed AST parser util.

Mediated org’s lack of QA by building a custom system utilizing Docker for running the prod environment locally with your own code injected, allowing sensitive logic to be verified before CD deployment.

Constructed 5-year roadmap to improve app performance and developer experience.

• Executed complete website analysis to discover and fix the largest CI/CD bottlenecks.
• Laid out instructions/metrics for transitioning from a monolithic structure to micro-frontends.
• Split shared component library to separate repo, published to AWS private registry, installed as dep in parents, and added local-dev utils for auto-auth renewals.
