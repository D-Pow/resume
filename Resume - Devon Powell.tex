\usepackage{textcomp}           % Add `\textquotesingle` and `\textquotedbl` for straight quotation marks

% Replacing all curly quotation marks with straight ones is surprisingly difficult
% due to their usage in different environments (e.g. math `$f(x)' = dx$`) and meanings
% in different commands (e.g. default quote behavior using `quoted-text').
% Double-quotes can be solved with some packages (`upquote` + `textcomp`),
% but there aren't any for single-quotes.
%
% Because of this, we could either:
%   - Wrap the whole `\begin{document}` in a new command:
%       \newcommand\usestraightquotes{%
%           \begingroup\lccode`~=`'
%           \lowercase{\endgroup\let~}\textquotesingle
%           \catcode`'=\active
%       }
%     which errors in math environments (i.e. `$f(x)' = dx$`).
%   - Use `\begin{verbatim}` environment (verbose for conjunctions).
%   - Use a regex replace (would interfere with math envs to make quotes not work).
%   - Redefining the `'` symbol (would cause all of the above).

    \item \textbf{Converted entire site from Flow to TypeScript}, consisting of millions of lines of code, via homebrewed AST parser util.

    \item \textbf{Constructed 5-year roadmap} to improve app performance and developer experience.
    \ul {
        \item Executed complete website analysis to discover and fix the largest CI/CD bottlenecks.

        \item Laid out instructions/metrics for transitioning from a monolithic structure to micro-frontends.

        \item Split shared component library to separate repo, published to AWS private registry, installed as dep in parents, and added local dev utils for auto-auth renewals.
    }

    % \item Upgraded website from \code{core-js@v2} to \code{core-js@v3}.
    % \item Enhance developer experience through tooling improvements, code organization, feature modernization, and leading the move from JavaScript to TypeScript.
